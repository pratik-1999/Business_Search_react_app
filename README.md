## Abstract

This project contains a React-based App that filters the local businesses based on three categories of affordability, user's rating counts, average ratings,  etc.
It helps you find the perfect one for you and displays the top dishes of that particular restuarant. The data is channeled through the yelp API that contains an enormous collection of local businesses.
